```{r setup, include=FALSE} 
# this chunk contains code that sets global options for the entire .Rmd. 
# we use include=FALSE to suppress it from the top of the document, but it will still appear in the appendix. 

knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE) # actually set the global chunk options. 
# we set echo=FALSE to suppress code such that it by default does not appear throughout the document. 
# note: this is different from .Rmd default
```

```{r ex1}
#Define a function that can double the data
double_data <- function(data) {
  result <- data * 2
  return(result)
}
```

## Appendix: All code in this assignment

```{r ref.label=knitr::all_labels(), echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE} 
# this chunk generates the complete code appendix. 
# eval=FALSE tells R not to run (``evaluate'') the code here (it was already run before).
```
